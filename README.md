<h3>Hello there!</h3>
I'm a self-taught software engineer passionate about computer graphics, programming language design and close-to-hardware optimizations.

<h3>About me:</h3>

- :spades: Iâ€™m currently working on a statically typed scripting language ([Soul](https://github.com/SandNoodle/Soul)).
- :heart: I love **hedgehogs** :hedgehog:.
- :seedling: I occasionally contribute to **Open-Source Software** projects.
